# Kubernetes Tutorial
**Kubernetes** is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across a cluster of hosts. This tutorial is just a lab guide for personal use only during early days of my Kubernetes journey. Never consider it as a reference for Kubernets. Please go to the project [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs) for more details about what Kubernets is and how does it work.
